# VisGist

## Intro

## Getting Started

Get a Public Access Token via `Github > Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained Tokens`

In `Visual Studio > Tools > Options > VisGist > General > Personal Access Token` enter your Personal Access  Token.

## Operational

Your Git Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored using encryption based on your local machine's hardware using the Data Protection API (DPAPI) system. Thus, you may need to re-enter your PAT if you're having problems.

## Options

Access via `Visual Studio > Tools > Options > VisGist`
