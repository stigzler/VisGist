# VisGist

## Intro
VisGist allows you to view, create and edit your gists from within Visual Studio. It also includes customizable syntax highlighting to make working with gists easier.

## Getting Started

Get a Public Access Token via `Github > Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained Tokens`.

In `Visual Studio > Tools > Options > VisGist > General > Personal Access Token` enter your Personal Access  Token.

## Operational

### Authentication

Your Git Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored using encryption based on your local machine's hardware using the Data Protection API (DPAPI) system. Thus, you may need to re-enter your PAT if you're having problems following any hardware changes. 

### Syntax Highlighting

rough: Light/Dark versions stored in AppData (show location). Appeal for others to contribute. Also mention that any Light/Dark pairs should have matching extensions as the matched extensions are based on the light version only. 

## Options

Access via `Visual Studio > Tools > Options > VisGist`
